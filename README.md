# MyProjects
A little repository that lists all my projects. Each repository has code and more information on each project.


Minecraft Minigames:

**Battle Clash**:

Core Plugins:

**HerobrinePVP-CORE**:
- Repo: https://github.com/HerobrineGamesYT/HerobrinePVP-CORE
- Description: A main server core plugin that works with GameCore to have a server that runs some pretty cool minigames. Manages a LOT of things such as user data, permissions, punishments, chat, and a whole lot more. Also just contains a whole lot of useful commands you'd want to have on any server.


**GameCore**:
- Repo: https://github.com/HerobrineGamesYT/GameCore
